For instance, a system for workers to undergo thorough compliance checks before they are made available to clients, and also a system for employers to leave feedback for staff based of their time working together which gives their profiles verification.",
        "Intelligence Care Services now have a one-stop solution for care workers to find new positions and connect with employers, and for employers to search and manage their staff directly."
